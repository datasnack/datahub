# Data Hub

The Data Hub is a geographic information system (GIS) featuring a data fusion engine designed for data harmonization, alongside an interactive dashboard for effective data exploration and collaboration. Its key objective is to merge data of multiple formats and sources across temporal and spatial axes, allowing users to combine, analyze, and interpret the data.

In [this repository](https://github.com/datasnack/dh-ghana) you can explore an example setup of the Data Hub software tailored to data concerning Ghana.


## Installation

The recommended way to use the Data Hub is via Docker and to reference the [container](https://github.com/datasnack/datahub/pkgs/container/datahub) built from this repository. See the [Ghana Data Hub](https://github.com/datasnack/dh-ghana) example for installation steps. By doing so it allows for updating the core system independent of you customizations.

To install the Data Hub from source, follow these steps:

- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Clone this repository and open it in your terminal
- Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.
- Install a PostGIS v16.x database (you can use the provided Docker image from the `docker-compose.yml`, `$ docker compose up -d postgis`).
- Create a Python v.3.12.x. virtual environment with `uv venv --python 3.12` and activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- Install Python dependencies via `uv sync` (might be complicated due to GDAL/PROJ dependencies).
- Run database migrations with `python manage.py migrate`
- Run Django with `python manage.py runserver`

The system is now running and usable at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), to use it:

- Create a new superuser with `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Import your Shapes with `python manage.py loadshapes <file>`
- Place your Data Layer source files in `src/datalayers/`
- Downloaded data will be placed in `data/datalayers/`
