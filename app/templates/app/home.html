<h1>Welcome to the {{ datahub_name }}</h1>
<h3>Give me a spin, I'm your Data Hub prototype in action!</h3>

<p>
	The <b>Data Hub</b> serves as a dynamic spatio-temporal information platform, tailored to the data practices of researchers.
	It offers an integrated view of various Data Layers relevant to yout study region, spanning multiple categories such as socio-demographic, environmental, weather, health, and infrastructure.
	These layers are compiled from user-based and open data sources (with some layers originating from the same source) to support data analysis and decision-making.
</p>

<p>
    The hub currently holds {{ shapes_count }} shapes, from the following types:
</p>
<ul>
{% for type in shape_types %}
    <li><a href="{{ type.get_absolute_url }}">{{ type.name }}</a> ({{ type.shapes.all.count }})</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>
	More details and in-depth documentation of each Data Layer can be accessed via its <a href="{% url 'datalayers:datalayer_index' %}">documentation page</a>, including metadata information.
</p>

<h3>Snack your Data</h3>
<p>
	To access the gathered open data sources you can browse them via the above mentioned shape types or the <a href="{% url "app:tools_picker" %}">location picker</a>.
	Upon choosing your area of interest, you can tailor your data selection through our download configurator, which also offers a basic preview (spatial and temporal description) of the data for your convenience.
