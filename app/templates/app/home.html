<h1>Welcome to the {{ datahub_name }}</h1>
<h3>Give me a spin, I'm your Data Hub prototype in action!</h3>

<p>
	The <b>Data Hub</b> serves as a dynamic spatio-temporal information platform, tailored to the data practices of researchers.
	It offers an integrated view of various Data Layers relevant to yout study region, spanning multiple categories such as socio-demographic, environmental, weather, health, and infrastructure.
	These layers are compiled from user-based and open data sources (with some layers originating from the same source) to support data analysis and decision-making.
</p>

<p>
    The hub currently holds {{ shapes_count }} shapes, from the following types:
</p>
<ul>
{% for type in shape_types %}
    <li><a href="{{ type.get_absolute_url }}">{{ type.name }}</a> ({{ type.shapes.all.count }})</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>
	More details and in-depth documentation of each Data Layer can be accessed via its <a href="{% url 'datalayers:datalayer_index' %}">documentation page</a>, including metadata information.
</p>

<h3>Snack your Data</h3>
<p>
	To access the gathered open data sources you can browse them via the above mentiond shape types or the Study Site picker.
	Upon choosing your area of interest, you can tailor your data selection through our download configurator, which also offers a basic preview (spatial and temporal description) of the data for your convenience.
